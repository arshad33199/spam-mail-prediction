## Problem Statement:
This is a Machine learning project with LogisticRegression.i am trying to predict the spam mail by the training the dataset.

![spam-filter](https://github.com/arshad33199/spam-mail-prediction/assets/142779412/db2aac2e-8182-43a2-9e28-912b2e9a1e06)



## Approach:

## Data Preprocessing:
counting ham mail and spam mail

I did some feature engineering in it convert spam mail as 0 and ham mail as 1  you can see in the notebook.


separating the data as text and label



This all the process i followed for test dataset as well and made a training and test dataset to feed in the Machine learning algorithm.



## Model Implementation:

I used  feature_extraction and logistic model to fit the dataset.

the Training data accuracy score which i got is 0.96% 

the Test data accuracy score which i got is 0.91%
